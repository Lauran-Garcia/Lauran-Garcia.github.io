								<h3>15 Year Comparison of Cropland Cover</h3>
								<p>This project analyzes land cover changes in the Silt, Colorado area from 2008 to 2023, 
								revealing notable shifts in vegetation and development patterns. Key findings include the conversion 
								of grassland and pasture to alfalfa, increased development around towns, expanded wetlands near the 
								Colorado River, and a transition of farmland from alfalfa to triticale and shrubland, possibly reflecting adaptations to drought and livestock needs</p>

								<h3>8 Year Comparison of Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index</h3>
								<p>This project analyzes vegetation changes in Silt, Colorado, between 2014 and 2022 using the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) 
								to assess the impact of development and drought on riparian and agricultural lands. The findings highlight a reduction in dense vegetation 
								and increased sprawl in historically agricultural areas, underscoring the importance of conservation efforts amid rising housing pressures.

								<h3>10th Mountain Division Hut System Avalanche Danger</h3>
								<p>This project assesses avalanche risk along the 10th Mountain Division Trail routes by identifying dangerous trail segments that intersect or lie within 100 meters 
								of steep slopes prone to avalanches. Using GIS tools to analyze slope data, the study provides rankings of hut routes based on avalanche risk, with recommendations for 
								safer huts near the Continental Divide and Camp Hale areas, particularly suited for beginners or families.</p>

								<h3>Comparison of Snow Depth and Snow Water Equivalent</h3>
								<p>This project analyzed the relationship between snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) in Colorado's Roaring Fork Valley, revealing strong correlations in January 
								that weakened by March. The findings highlighted significant discrepancies between snow depth and SWE at higher elevations, suggesting variations in snowpack density over time.</p>
